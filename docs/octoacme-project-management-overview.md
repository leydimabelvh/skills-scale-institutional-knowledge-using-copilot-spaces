# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile ceremonies, removes impediments, coaches team.
- **Engineering Lead**: Oversees technical delivery, architecture, and engineering standards.
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **UX Designer**: Creates user-centered designs, validates usability, delivers design assets.
- **QA/Test Engineers**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria through systematic testing.
- **Compliance/Regulatory Stakeholder**: Reviews changes for legal and regulatory alignment.
- **Support/Customer Success**: Provides customer feedback, validates fixes, ensures release readiness.
- **Other Stakeholders**: Provide domain-specific inputs and approvals as needed.

5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
