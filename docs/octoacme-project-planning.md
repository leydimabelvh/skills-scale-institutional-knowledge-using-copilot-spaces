# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Participants: PM, Product Manager, Engineering Lead, Scrum Master, Developers, UX Designer, QA/Test, and relevant stakeholders (Compliance, Support)
2. **Create prioritized backlog** with acceptance criteria
   - Product Manager leads prioritization with input from UX Designer and Engineering Lead
3. **Estimate scope** (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Led by Scrum Master, with Developers and Engineering Lead providing estimates
4. **Define Definition of Done (DoD)**
   - Collaborative effort including QA/Test, Developers, and Engineering Lead
5. **Identify dependencies and integration points**
   - Engineering Lead identifies technical dependencies; PM tracks cross-team dependencies
6. **Create release plan and milestone map**
   - PM coordinates with Product Manager, Engineering Lead, and Compliance (if required)
